		<h3>How to use Better Text View</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <img src="assets/icons/halo.png" alt="Better Text View" id = "ico"> button in the browser address bar manages the options for the current page. If it is not visible, you need to click on "Extensions" icon and "Pin" the Better Text View plugin to the toolbar.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
<h4>NEW CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix for exporting of whitelist did not store all items in list.</li>
<li>New option in Reverse colors for processing Before / After pseudo elements' background images which are then correctly displayed.</li>
<li>Setting (enable "Skip links" and disable "Start 3 letters") makes the Font Weight slider proportional to inverse text size calculations. 400 weight is default "inverted text size change" whose amount decreases at font weight of 300 .. 100 .. 900 .. 500 with 500 being "normal" website text with no "inverse text size change". If a site has VERY bad layout due to inverted text sizing, decrease the font weight to 100 / 900 .. 500 which will keep original font size settings. The setting is enabled by making "skip links in start 3" enabled and "start 3 letters bold"disable.</li>
<li>New "Font name" setting makes all text of font type as specified in setting. For example, enter 'Sans-Serif' / 'Serif' / 'monospace' (no quotes) in "Font name" text box and refresh page to get all text of that font type (or name).</li>
<li>Global settings are saved when exporting a whitelist to a file.</li>
<li>New option to Disable Better Text View on a site temporarily while keeping settings instead of deleting them (which Blacklist does).</li>
<li>Zoom % is now dynamically changed by adjusting Strength slider, without having to refresh the page.</li>
<li>Holding Shift key down and moving mouse over any text area will "ZOOM" the text in that area by 175% (or by Strength % if slider is not zero) when "Num Lock" key is on.</li>
<li>"Force max opacity" now changes background color of BODY element only if "Force Reverse colors" is enabled AND "High contrast dark mode" is disabled. Other effect of making text totally opaque does not depend on any other options.</li>
<li>31 Presets can be defined with custom settings of sliders and options. These presets can be loaded to quickly change the settings to particular configuration for a site.</li>
<li>In Dark mode and Reverse colors mode, the Brightness and Contrast sliders now <b>update the colors while changing</b> instead of requiring a refesh of webpage. This works in "Dark mode" and "Reverse colors" mode, but for normal pages there is no brightness / contrast change.</li>
<li>The "High contrast dark mode" option, when enabled even though Dark mode is disabled, does processing of text colors by newer method (which is still work in progress). Disabling it reverts the text color contrast logic to older method.</li>
<li>Strength slider controls the "brightness" threshold below which text contrast is increased to black / white. As before, negative settings preserve colors and high positive settings create greater contrast (only if colors of text are "contrast-friendly", grey on dark background will not become white, or light color on white background become black).</li>
<li>Option "High contrast dark mode" makes greater contrast when brighness / contrast settings are changed in Dark mode. If enabled with/without dark mode, a newer text contrast method is used. If text contrast is not working as expected, try disabling this option to revert to old method of text contrast.</li>
<li>"Colorblind adjusted colors" which changes colors of text to suit colorblind condition. In dark mode or reverse colors, the text hue is changed toward green color while in normal light theme, the text is changed for blue color.</li>
<li>If strength is an ODD number, input textbox color is changed to black/white depending on its color.</li>
<li>Color shades of text (and backgrounds somewhat) can be made similar to original website by enabling "Reverse colors hue correction".</li>
<li>"Skip text height changes" avoids changing font heights of text and INPUT elements like text boxes and select boxes.</li>
<li>New option to add custom CSS rules to the site</li>
<li>If either of "Dark mode" or "Reverse Colors" is enabled in global options, all websites colors are changed to "dark theme" colors. If the theme calculates "Lightness" wrong, then enable both "Reverse colors" and "Dark mode" to override the wrongly computed theme.</li>
<li>"Reverse Colors" & "Invert Image colors" correctly displays most emojis, but speed is slow.</li>
<li><b>IMPORTANT</b>: When the settings of "Font increase %" and "Font Threshold" are VERY HIGH, to make text appear MUCH BIGGER, the browser's "Text Size" Setting SHOULD ALSO BE CHANGED TO "LARGE/VERY LARGE" or "18 px to 24 px". Otherwise on some pages OVERLAPPING/CUTTING of text MAY occur.</li>
<li><b>DO NOT ENABLE BOTH "Dark Mode" and "Force Reverse Colors".</b> This condition is not considered and there will be problems in results.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4>ABOUT EXTENSION</h4>
<b>TL;DR</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Font size within threshold is enlarged inversely with font size. That means small text made bigger than large text.</li>
<li>Font Weight slider changes thin/bold-ness of ALL text, and bold and normal letters weight when "Start 3 letters bold" is enabled.</li>
<li>Dark mode changes Contrast and Brightness of "black" themed sites. Pictures are kept normal but if "High contrast dark mode" is enabled, the brightness / contrast effect is greater and images get distorted colors.</li>
<li>In Dark mode and Reverse colors the text brightness and contrast can be changed by their sliders.</li>
<li>The "Force Reverse Colors" option is useful for changing colors of sites to "Dark Theme" or "Dark Reader" view while preserving (most of) images' colors and background and text colors. Image colors are reversed by disabling "Invert image colors" and text / background colors change disabled by "Reverse Colors hue correction".
<li>ALL CAPITAL TEXT option makes all webpage text in capitals and also works on NON-ENGLISH languages.</li>
<li>Starting 3 letters bold option makes all words first 3 letters <b>bold</b> for most languages. If there are problems with some links or menus not working, enable "Skip links in 3 letters bold" option to avoid making links bold.</li>
<li>The popup options show the "Lightness" value of current site. If less than 0.5, then it is "Dark themed", if more than 0.5, it is "Light themed". Dark themed sites can be changed by "Dark mode" while "Light themed" sites can be changed by "Reverse Colors".</li>
<li>Enabling "Apply custom CSS for site" will allow you to enter custom CSS rules for the site</li>
</ul>
<h4>DETAILS</h4>
<ul>
<li>The text size is increased inversely depending on its size. This means small sized text is made much bigger than larger text, which is slightly increased in size. All text within size of Threshold setting is increased in size with text closer to Font Threshold size increasing less than text much lower size than Threshold, depending of Font Increae % setting.</li>
<li>If "Activate on all websites" option is disabled only "whitelisted" sites are changed, else ALL sites get processed.</li>
<li>Frames inside of site are also processed, but their settings are of the origin site of the frame, which MAY NOT be the site displayed in address box.</li>
<li>Brightness Slider controls the brightness of text/background with 0 to 300% range for "Dark mode" and -300 to 300 for "Reverse colors".</li>
<li>The colors of text are changed for maximum contrast depending on value of "Strength" slider (unless "Avoid colorful text" is selected which skips "colorful" text,  and if "Skip white text" option is enabled, which skips WHITE text). If greater than 200, text colors change for maximum contrast.</li>
<li>By increasing "Strength" setting to above 200, the text can be made black on light background or white on black background (if dark mode is enabled) depending on brightness of background color ("Avoid colorful text" and "Skip white text" is ignored).</li>
<li>Decreasing "Strength" setting to negative values like -120 or -250 can restore the original text colors of website instead of high contrast black / white text.</li>
<li>If Strength is ODD value, and there are INPUT text boxes on site, the input text will be made black / white depending on color.</li>
<li>The "Font Weight" slider can be changed to lowest 100 (very thin) upto 900 (very thick/bold) text. This is useful for adjusting sites having very thin text or very bold and thick text. When "Start 3 letters bold" is enabled, (slider value + 400) is taken as weight of bold letters and noramal text has weight of (slider value) if slider is less than 500. For slider above 400, the slider value is taken as weight of 3 letters and all other text is normal.</li>
<li>Before a preset is made, select the preset number at the very start. Then make the customizations and finally click "Save" to save to a number between 1 to 31. This saved preset can be loaded by clicking "Load" after selecting the number of preset. Clicking "Refresh" button after all steps is recommended of knowing preset has been saved / loaded. Presets are stored in the "whitelist" list so exporting whitelist to a file will also save presets. <b>Settings with a selected preset do not get automatically updated if a preset is changed. One has to "Load" the preset again.</b></li>
<li>ALL CAPITAL TEXT option makes all webpage text in capitals. It ALSO works on NON-ENGLISH languages.</li>
<li>Starting 3 letters bold option makes all words first 3 letters <b>bold</b> and also works for NON-ENGLISH languages. If there are problems with some links or menus not working, enable "Skip links in 3 letters bold" option to avoid making links bold.</li>
<li>The "Dark Mode" option is for black themes and, when enabled, allows increasing of Brightness (by the "Brightness" slider, range 0 to 300) and Contrast (by the "Contrast" slider, range 0 to 300) of text and background colors.</li>
<li>A "Force Reverse Colors" option allows site to "Reverse" colors, so that a light site becomes black. It is useful for changing colors of sites to "Dark Theme" or "Dark Reader" view while preserving (most of) images' colors. In case a webpage does not have its background color reversed, enabling "Force max opacity" will force a reversal of the background color (but only if "High contrast dark mode" is disabled).</li>
<li>The "Invert Image Colors" option, which appears when "Force Reverse Colors" is enabled, causes images and videos colors to be inverted, so due to double inversion images and videos become normal. If it is disabled, the images and videos are not doubly inverted in color, causing them to look "reverse color".</li>
<li>Reverse color hue correction changes colors to match original website in reverse colors..</li>
<li>Option "Process :before/:after elements" in Reverse colors for processing Before / After pseudo elements' background images which are then correctly displayed (but only if "Invert image colors" is enabled). If any images in reverse colors are displayed in reverse colors, try enabling this option, with "Invert image colors" also enabled.</li>
<li>The text brightness and contrast can be changed by the sliders when "Reverse colors" is enabled. To revert to original brightness and contrast, set Strength to 0 and Contrast to 50.</li>
<li>The popup options box show the "Lightness" value of current site. If less than 0.5, then it is considered "Dark themed", if more than 0.5, it is "Light themed". Dark themed site colors can be changed by "Dark mode" while "Light themed" site colors can be changed through "Reverse Colors". Some few sites may detect theme wrong, then enable BOTH Dark mode and Reverse colors to force site color changes.</li>
<li>If "High contrast Dark mode" is enabled in Dark mode, then brightness and contrast are applied to more elements and images (which can distort colors of some images). Newer method of calculating black / white / high contrast text color is used. When disabled with "Force max opacity" enabled background color of HTML BODY is reversed.</li>
<li>The menu and large sections of webpage are increased in size according to the Font Increase % and Input elements increased by Font Threshold. If there are problems in display of menus / header imaages or large tables overlap, enable "Skip NAV & SECTION" checkbox. The "Skip NAV & SECTION" also skips applying Reverse Color to images inside NAV and HEADER elements, which are (usually) on top menu of webpage, when "Force Reverse colors" is enabled.</li>
<li>"Skip text height changes" will not change heights of text, and INPUT elements like text and select boxes.</li>
<li>'Colorblind adjust colors' when enabled changes text colors and background to suit colorblind condition. In dark mode or reverse colors, the text hue is changed toward green color while in normal light theme, the text is changed for blue color.</li>
<li>Enabling "Apply custom CSS for site" will allow you to enter custom CSS rules for the site</li>
<li>The "Disable Better Text View on this site temporarily (keep settings)" option keeps settings saved while blacklisting (making no changes) the site. If the settings on a site need to be temporarily disabled, use this option insted of "Disable Better Text View on this site".</li>
<li>"Font name" option allows changing font of all text of page with the font entered in textbox. After putting font name in textbox, press Enter and the font will change immediately without requiring refresh of page.</li>
<li>The "inverse text size" increase can be reduced to "normal size" by changing font weight after the setting "skip links" enabled and "start 3 bold" disabled.</li>
<li>Additional features are input box borders, underlining of links, forcing maximum opacity of transparent elements and saving/loading of settings whitelists/blacklists,</li>
<li>This extension is helpful for people who require reading glasses / spectacles due to far-sight / long-sight / hypermetropia / hyperopia condition of eyes.<b>HOWEVER IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR READING GLASSES / OPTICAL LENSES.</b></li>
<li><b>VERY IMPORTANT WARNING</b>: If you are COPY+PASTE-ing from a page which has been changed by this plugin, DISABLE the plugin for that webpage and THEN copy + paste. If you are editing or submitting HTML content online using a content management system like Wordpress or having an HTML Editor, DISABLE this extension for that particular site. Otherwise, the HTML will contain unwanted styling elements generated by the extension.</li>
<li>WHEM PRINTING A WEBPAGE modified by this extension, KEEP "Disable for this site (keep settings)" enabled otherwise the PRINTING WON'T BE CORRECT.</li>
<li><b><em>SPEED of page processing is SLOW. There are some options to increase speed of font changes / colors and enabling / disabling any or all of - "Skip text height change" / "Skip NAV SECTION" / "Avoid colorful text" / "Reverse colors hue correction" / "Process :before/:after elements" -  can run little faster.</em></b></li>
</ul>

<h4>SUGGESTIONS OR ISSUES</h4>
<ul>

<li style="font-family:mono,monospace!important;">Please excuse me, "the developer", from issues related to speed / slowness or bugs about text / background colors. I work alone on this extension and nobody tests this except me, myself and i. Also my brain isn't what it used to be when young (i'm over 50 years old) so there are no <i>clever</i> speed optimizations or methods in the underlying code. Thanks for running this and hope the extension improves your browsing experience. Sincerely, the developer.</li></ul></p>
